Journal for Research Methods in the Humanites

## State of the Platform
The static blog format is used for prototyping for a optimal solution to provide researchers
from the humanities the ability to publish their research methods in an open way. This
helps researchers on the one hand to receive feedback from fellow researchers on their
methods, on the other hand it helps other researchers and students to see how research is actually
done.
