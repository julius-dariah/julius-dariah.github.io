# A platform to publish, share, and discuss research methods

While researchers are able to publish papers and articles about their data on various open access platforms, other parts of research are seldom minded. This website aims to provide researchers a publishing platform to describe methods that are used for research in the humanities. Further this platform should be used to discuss published methods and provide feedback to the reasearchers.
An important part of publishing in the digital humanities are peer reviews. This platform will not contain means for direct peer reviews, instead authors are advised to use one of the many platforms available that offer peer reviews for external articles. Later we hope this platform than can incorporate links to the reviews and mark reviewed articles accordingly.

## Publishing

To publish an article about a research method the author needs to have an account at [Github][]. Researchers can open an issue for the [repository][] of this website. The issues should be labed as *'submission'*.
The issue should contain the title of the artice, if possible together with a version number, also it's description should contain the authors name and favored tags or categories. The article itself can be submitted as file in following formats: reStructuredText, Markdown, LateX or Jupyter Notebooks.
To provide readers of the blog with a better experience, the article should contain a short abstract which will be used as teaser on the main page.

# Commenting

Every post contains a comment section on the bottom powered by [Disqus][]. To comment on an article, users need an account within Disqus. If the author of the article wants to publish an new version of the post with incorporated suggestions from the comments, she needs to re-submit the article.
