# About

This website aims to provide researchers from the humanities a platform to publish, share, and discuss research methods. It is currently maintained by Julius Peinelt within the [Humanities at Scale][HaS] project at [DARIAH].

It is hosted on [Github Pages] and utilizes [Nikola] as a static page engine. The design is based on Nikolas [bootblog] theme with the [Jinja] template engine. Its appearance is with some minor correction completely based on the [Paper] theme by [Thomas Park].
